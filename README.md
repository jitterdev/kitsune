kitsune 

= every new moon, if you meet the requirements for your next tail, you will gain a tail.

= this only works in the overworld, because… the end and nether don’t have a moon

= you can only gain 1 tail every new moon

= you can have a max of 9 tails

= the thresholds for these tails increment by 10 levels for each tail, starting at 20 (2nd tail takes 20, 3rd takes 30, etcetera)

= so getting your 2nd tail consumes 20 levels worth of xp, the 3rd tail consumes 30 levels, and so on.

= tails are kept on death
