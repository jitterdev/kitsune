# kitsune

kitsune 

= every new moon, if you meet the requirements for your next tail, you will gain a tail

= this only works in the overworld, because… the end and nether don’t have a moon

= you can only gain 1 tail every new moon

= you can have a max of 9 tails

= the thresholds for these tails increment by 10 levels for each tail, starting at 20 (2nd tail takes 20, 3rd takes 30, etcetera)

= so getting your 2nd tail consumes 20 levels worth of xp, the 3rd tail consumes 30 levels, and so on.

= you cannot gain your 8th and 9th tail until you have killed the wither and ender dragon respectively

[2]
+ your movements no longer alert sculk sensors

[3]
+ wild foxes begin to recognize your status, and will fight alongside you and act as if tamed by you.

[4]
+ your invisibility power is instead replaced with a bar. The bar drains proportionally to how much you move while invisible (moving a lot drains it quickly, moving a little drains slowly). Takes 20 seconds to recharge to full when empty. Activated with [TERNARY].
(hidden):
= armor and held items are still visible (like the base invisibility power at 1 tail).
- getting hit while invisible makes you visible again.

[5]
+ you gain even more additional speed while below 4 hearts.

= pounce cooldown decreased to 2 seconds.

+ you gain a short multidirectional dash. Activated with [QUINARY].

+ you gain the ability to wall jump by sneaking in midair while touching a wall. Once you let go of sneak, you jump off of the wall.

+ you gain the ability to double jump.
+ modifiers to your walking speed also apply while you're airborne.
- your armor toughness is half as effective.
